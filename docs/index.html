# this guide is in motion

fear no question, ask them at [llllllll.co/t/kolor](https://llllllll.co/t/kolor)

the name "כל אור" is Hebrew for "every light"

it is pronounced *kol*-*or*

it is meant to signify that every light is used on the monome grid

hopefully in an intuitive way

---

# installation

first download

then add these lines to any norns script*:

```lua
kolor = include("lib/kolor")
kolor:new()
```

<small>*any norns script that doesn't already use grid, that is</small>

### you should know...

*mod* = modulator (volume, pan, filters, sample positions, etc.)

*sound* = one of the six sample sounds

*step* = position with assigned *sound* and *mod*

*track* = collection of *steps*

*pattern* = collection of *tracks* (up to six)

---

---

### you should know...

the brightness of each step indicates whether it is active

unless a mod is selected, then

the brightness of each step indicates its value for that mod

---

---

### you should know...

recording is quantized to the current track's division 

which is set using the *clock* (more on that later)


also, if a mod is active (more on that later, too) its current
parameter will be pushed onto any activated step

---


### you should know...

samples are stereo `.wav` files stored in

`~/dust/audio/samples/bank[1-6]`

each bank shows 32 samples in alphabetical order

each sound selects from its respective bank

---

### you should know...

each track has its own clock

the track with the most steps determines when to transition
to the next pattern

---

---

### you should know...

markov chaining 

is where each pattern has a probability to transition

to any other pattern

changing those probabilities gives different chaining behaviors

---

---

### you should know...

there are ten mods:

- volume (0 to 1)
- rate (-200% to 200%)
- pan (-1 to 1)
- low-pass filter (20 hz to 9k hz)
- resonance (0 to 2)
- high-pass filter (8k hz to 20k hz)
- sample start (0 to 100% of length)
- sample end position (0 to 100% of length)
- retrig number (0 to 15 times)
- probability (0 to 100%)
- lfo lfo (0 to 64 beats)

turn a mod on or off by pressing

active mod blinks

---

### you should also know...

when a step is not selected (i.e. no steps blinking), then you are editing the default parameters for the mods

the current defaults are automatically put onto any new steps

you can copy parameters from any active step into the defaults (next slide)

---

![img](./lfo.jpeg)

---

### you should know...

lfos are specific to each mod

turn a lfo off by pressing lfo on the mod scale and pressing the first button in the lfo scale (row 5, column 1)

this is the most menu diving you'll ever have to do

need to 

be
