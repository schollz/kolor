# this guide is in motion

fear no question, ask them at [llllllll.co/t/kolor](https://llllllll.co/t/kolor)

the name "כל אור" is Hebrew for "every light"

it is pronounced *kol*-*or*

it is meant to signify that every light is used on the monome grid

hopefully in an intuitive way

---

# install

first download and then either (1) open the *kolor* script in norns to use norns-grid:

<center>
<img src="./norns.png" style="width:250px">
</center>

or (2) add these lines to any norns script\* to use with an actual grid:

```lua
kolor = include("lib/kolor")
kolor:new()
```

<small style="font-size:0.75em;font-weight:400">*any norns script that doesn't already use grid. and if the host script uses an engine you need to merge engines.</small>

### you should know...

*mod* = modulator (volume, pan, filters, sample positions, etc.)

*sound* = one of the six sample sounds

*step* = position with assigned *sound* and *mod*

*track* = collection of *steps*

*pattern* = collection of *tracks* (up to six)

also, the "beat scale" changes to a "parameter scale" when mod selected

---

![img](./play.jpeg)

---

### you should know...

the brightness of each *step* indicates whether it is active

unless a *mod* is selected, then

the brightness of each *step* indicates its value for that *mod*

---

![img](./record.jpeg)

---

### you should know...

recording is quantized to the current track's division 

which is set using the *clock* (more on that later)


also, if a mod is active (more on that later, too) its current
parameter will be pushed onto any activated step

---

---


### you should know...

samples are stereo `.wav` files stored in

`~/dust/audio/samples/bank[1-6]`

each bank shows 32 samples in alphabetical order

each sound selects from its respective bank

add your own

they'll appear there too

---

### you should know...

each track has its own clock

the track with the most steps determines when to transition
to the next pattern

---

![img](./cue.jpeg)


---

### you should know...

markov chaining 

is where each pattern has a probability to transition

to any other pattern

changing those probabilities gives different chaining behaviors

---

---

### you should know...

there are twelve mods:

- volume (0 to 1)
- rate (-200% to 200%)
- pan (-1 to 1)
- low-pass filter (20 hz to 9k hz)
- resonance (0 to 2)
- high-pass filter (8k hz to 20k hz)
- sample start (0 to 100% of length)
- sample end position (0 to 100% of length)
- retrig number (0 to 15 times)
- probability (0 to 100%)
- lfo lfo (0 to 64 beats)
- delay send (0 to 100%)
- delay length (1 to 16 beats)

toggle mod scale by pressing active mod (blinking)

---

### you should also know...

when a step is not selected (i.e. no steps blinking), then you are editing the default parameters for the mods

the current defaults are automatically put onto any new steps

each sound has its own default 

you can copy parameters from any active step into the defaults (next slide)

---

---

![img](./lfo.jpeg)

---

### you should know...

lfos are specific to each mod

turn a lfo off by pressing lfo on the mod scale and pressing the first button in the lfo scale (row 5, column 1)

this is the most menu diving you'll ever have to do

# save/load

saving and loading is done via the parameters menu

`PARAMETERS -> KOLOR`

_note:_ saving and loading might take up to 5 seconds

---

# misc info

you can copy patterns, hold one pattern to copy and another to paste it to

# you should know

you are exactly
